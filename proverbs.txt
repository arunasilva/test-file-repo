Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.
Beggars can't be choosers.
The best things in life are free.
Charity begins at home.

The first step is always the hardest.
Good things come in small packages.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Two wrongs don't make a right
The pen is mightier than the sword

When in Rome, do as the Romans
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst
Better late than never
master-1

A watched pot never boils
hello...
The grass is always greener on the other side of the hill
